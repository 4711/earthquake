Representing the magnitude of an earthquake with a circle can be tricky. An earthquake has a epicenter (latitude and longitude), depth (meters) and a magnitude in the Richter scale. 

The Richter scale is a measure of the energy liberated by the earthquake, and is a logarithmic scale. A seismic event of magnitude 5.0 releases about 32 times the energy released by one of magnitude 4.0. Usually, the area of the circles must map to the magnitude shown in the visualization, in this case, we will use something different. 

Having lived in a seismic country for almost my entire life, I think that showing the *impact* zone of an earthquake is most apropiate, thinking as the impact as the zone where the earthquake was relevant. For example, a recent earthquake of magnitude 6.2 near Coquimbo Chile

![Did you feel it?](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/product/dyfi/usc000dski/us/1353588990812/usc000dski_ciim.jpg#usemap=imap_base "Did you feel it?")

People living in the suroundings reported how they felt the earthquake (109 responses in 33 cities), we can see that in Vallenar and Coquimbo, the earthquake was felt as "Moderate", establishing the moderate level as the frontier of the impact. The difficulty is that the the impact is not always a circle, and the representation will be always not that accurate.
